# Planar Deformation
This program applies the Finite Elements Method (FEM) by reading from a .txt file the information needed to form a mesh over a given part. Then it calculates and presents the distribution of deformations and tensions on that part given an applied pressure (also provided in the .txt file).
The program is a part of a school project.
